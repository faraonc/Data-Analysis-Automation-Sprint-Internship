Q. My Ubuntu was reinstalled. How to install tools?
A. Use the script "install.sh". Execute "bash install.sh" if it does not work, then you can copy, paste, execute each line in the terminal.

Q. My CentOS was reinstalled. How to install tools?
A. This is the trickiest part. You may have to check the script "install.sh" and replace each "apt-get" with "yum".
   If some of the lines do not work then you may have to manually rebuild these tools using rpm to work with python3.6.
   It took me a lot research and I had to manually copy files to install all the tools.
   Unfortunately, I did not expect the computer to crash and I have no log of how I managed to install tools.

Q. There are bugs, and I have problems with the scripts.
A. You can send me an email at faraonc@uw.edu or faraonc@outlook.com.
   I will be glad to fix the problem, or even come in to fix and to explain stuff.
   Additionally, consult the manual for further details for bugs and optimization.
